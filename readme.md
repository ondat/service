# Dataplane-Controlplane service definition project

Comments go into the dataplane/dataplane.proto file. The more - the better.

## Installation

To use this software, you must:
- Install the standard C++ implementation of protocol buffers from
	https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
- Of course, install the Go compiler and tools from
	https://golang.org/
  See
	https://golang.org/doc/install
  for details or, if you are using gccgo, follow the instructions at
	https://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo
- Grab the code from the repository and install the proto package.
  The simplest way is to run `go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go`.
  The compiler plugin, protoc-gen-go, will be installed in $GOBIN,
  defaulting to $GOPATH/bin.  It must be in your $PATH for the protocol
  compiler, protoc, to find it.

This software has two parts: a 'protocol compiler plugin' that
generates Go source files that, once compiled, can access and manage
protocol buffers; and a library that implements run-time support for
encoding (marshaling), decoding (unmarshaling), and accessing protocol
buffers. 

There is support for gRPC in Go using protocol buffers.
See the note at the bottom of this file for details.

## Generate Go package

To generate a Go package:

```
make go
```

The generated files will be suffixed .pb.go. See the `dataplane/dataplane.pb.go` code.

## gRPC Support

If a proto file specifies RPC services, protoc-gen-go can be instructed to
generate code compatible with gRPC (http://www.grpc.io/). To do this, pass
the `plugins` parameter to protoc-gen-go; the usual way is to insert it into
the --go_out argument to protoc:

	protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. *.proto
